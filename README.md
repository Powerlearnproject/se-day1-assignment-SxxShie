Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of using engineering tools and principles to design, develop, test and mantain software programmes.
The importance of software engineering is that it reduces complexity while solving our problems, allowing people to focus on much more complicated problems,

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Agile model -  
Cloud computing
Spiral Model

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1.Project Planning - This stage about what we want.
2.Requirements & Analysis - The second step of SDLC is gathering maximum information from the client requirements for the product.
3.Design - In the design phase (3rd step of SDLC), the program developer scrutinizes whether the prepared software suffices all the requirements of the end-user.
4.Coding or Implementation - translating the design to a computer-legible language. In this fourth stage of SDLC, the tasks are divided into modules or units and assigned to various developers.
5.Testing - Once the developers build the software, then it is deployed in the testing environment. Then the testing team tests the functionality of the entire system
6.Deployment - Once the testing is done, and the product is ready for deployment, it is released for customers to use.
7.Maintenance - The actual problem starts when the customer actually starts using the developed system and those needs to be solved from time to time. Maintenance is the seventh phase of SDLC where the developed product is taken care of. According to the changing user end environment or technology, the software is updated timely.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Model:  We finish with one phase and then start with the next, with the help of this methodology. it is best to use it if All the requirements are known, clear, and fixed. There are no ambiguous requirements.

Agile Model -  it approaches software development in incremental but rapid cycles, commonly referred to as “sprints”. With new changes in scope and direction being implemented in each sprint, the project can be completed quickly with higher flexibility. It is  better suited for ongoing projects and projects where certain details aren't known from the outset

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software DEveloper - Document and maintain software functionality
Quality Assurance Engineer - Planning and Automating tests
Project Manager - stakeholder communication and time management


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs - DEs are equipped with a host of features, such as code completion, syntax highlighting, and error detection, that can speed up the coding process. These features not only help you write code faster but also reduce the time spent on debugging and fixing errors. For example Visual studio and Android studio.
VCS - Version control systems enable collaboration among developers regardless of their physical location. Team members can work on their assigned tasks independently, and VCS ensures that changes are seamlessly integrated into the codebase, enhancing productivity and encouraging smooth workflow. For example Git, SubVersion and mercurial.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Scalability - we can overcome this by Defining coding standards to write scalable code.
Security - we can overcome this by using security testing tools & platforms for enhanced security.
Performance Challenges - we can overcome this by implementing infrastructure observability and monitoring tools for enhanced performance.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is the process of checking small pieces of code to deliver information early and often,
integration testing is  type of software testing in which various modules in an application are tested as a combined unit.
System testing verifies that an application performs tasks as designed. It's a type of black box testing that focuses on the functionality of an application 
Acceptance testing is a process that establishes whether an application meets the end user standards based on predetermined characteristics

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering refers to the act of structuring your queries or questions in a way that makes it easy for your AI assistant to give you a relevent answer. Prompt engineering is important because it allows you to describe how you want your answer to be structured.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague : I would like you to generate a picture of bridge 
improved: From an orthophoto point of view, i would like you to generate a picture of a bridge flooded by morning traffic with a river flowing underneath. 
This text was improved by adding an explanation of how we want the image generated to look like.
